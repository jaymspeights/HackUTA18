Walk Me Amadeus is a crowdsourced pathing app. 
The idea is that the fastest walking path in an environment such as a school campus is not always the shortest distance, nor is the environment easily mappable by computers. 
By utilizing crowdsourced path data, we can create a weighted map of previously traveled paths that can take distance, speed, 'maturity', and weight of the path combined with an intelligent pathing algorithm to find the fastest possible path for the user.
